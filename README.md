# Service Automation Toolkit (Python)

A command-line Python tool that simulates a real-world service desk workflow.  
It validates customer service tickets, builds structured job records, and outputs clean, human-readable service summaries.

This project demonstrates practical automation, modular Python design, and readable output suitable for operational or support environments.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

This project was built to demonstrate how Python can be used to automate everyday service and field-support workflows.

It mirrors real technician and service-desk tasks such as:
- Accepting structured user input
- Validating required information
- Creating standardized job records
- Producing clean, readable summaries for reporting or documentation

The goal is to showcase practical, entry-level Python skills that translate directly to real operational environments.
